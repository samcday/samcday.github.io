    <h1>Hi.</h1>
    <p>This is the website of Sam Day. He's a guy. He's an Australian who lived in Brisbane, Sydney, San Francisco, and currently lives in Berlin.</p>
    <p>You can reach him by writing an email to <b>me@</b> + the domain of the website you're currently on.</p>
    <p>He's not on any social media. You can find him on <a href="https://t.me/samcday">Telegram</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>
    <p>Sam sometimes writes code, and sometimes subjects the world to that code by pushing it to <a href="https://github.com/samcday">Github</a>.</p>
    <p>Sam does not have LinkedIn. He does not want to work for/with/around/near you if you're in fintech, "Uber for x", blockchain anything, or any of the parasitic FAANG companies. If you happen to be working on anything interesting connected to smart grid, sustainable development, circular economy, local resiliency, etc, he'd probably love to hear from you!</p>
